# Sable AI Assistant

Give AI some tasks and they will help you to call the specific backend services and perform actions on them

### Challenges

Since this is an injected script and especially that this project was initially built from Tailwind, it may not work as well as expected when loaded in various pages. In the future, it will be best to change the styling into pure CSS to avoid clashing or the rem definition or classnames

### References

This code base was forked from [Boilerplate](https://github.com/yosevu/react-content-script)
